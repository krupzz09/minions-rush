<p>The Minions speak in a fictional polyglot language, called Minionese, which is partly derived from other languages, including French, English, 
Japanese, Korean, Italian, Spanish, and German. Although seemingly nonsensical, the English-sounding dialogue is dubbed differently for every country,
 in order to make the sounds somewhat recognizable. They have common English-language names, such as Dave (one of the first known minions in the franchise),
 Kevin, Stuart, Bob (the lead trio in Minions and Minions: The Rise of Gru), Mel (the leader of the Minions in Despicable Me 
3 after Gru refuses their request of him returning to being a supervillain), and Otto (the fourth lead Minion in Minions: The Rise of Gru).</p></center>
