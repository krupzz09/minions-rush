<p>Agnes Gru is one of Gru and Lucy's three adopted daughters, alongside her big sisters Margo and Edith.
 She is the youngest child of the three sisters.
 She greatly adores unicorns, as shown on various occasions.
 She appears in all four Despicable Me films and several of the mini movies.Agnes is a little girl with dark brown eyes.
 Her long black hair is tied in an upwards ponytail with a bright red scrunchie. 
 Most of the time, Agnes wears steel blue overalls over a yellow and brown striped t-shirt, and white sneakers with yellow socks. 
 She also wears a white ballet outfit like Edith and Margo (at the ballet recital). For pajamas, Agnes wears a long blue nightshirt covered with teddy bears and polar bear slippers; her hair stays the same. On her birthday, Agnes is wearing a dress that resembles a princess riding a unicorn. T
 he colors are similar to her regular outfit. She also wears a blue princess hat on her head.</p></center>
