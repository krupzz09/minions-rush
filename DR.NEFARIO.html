<p>Dr. Nefario resembles a stereotypical mad scientist who is mildly overweight. 
He is always seen with his lab coat, gloves, and trademark goggles, and he wears either pants or pajama bottoms with a plaid pattern. 
His hair, what little there is of it, is longish and faintly unruly.Dr. Nefario is Gru's closest and most loyal friend who always comes to his rescue. He has a very high respect for Gru and even believes he is the greatest villain in the world, but he often doubts his abilities and motives. He is also quite eccentric with rather bad hearing due to his age,
 but although he seemed a little odd at times, he did not seem to be going senile</p></center>
