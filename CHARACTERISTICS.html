<p>The Minions are small, yellow capsule-shaped creatures with round gray goggles. They are depicted
 as being roughly one-third to one-half the height of humans but they were later revealed to be 3 feet 7 inches 
 (1.1 m) tall. They have one or two eyes, and their irises are almost always brown (except for Bob, who has one green and 
 one brown eye). They have three fingers and toes per hand and foot, respectively. There appears to be no other difference between the
two types beyond the number and color of eyes, and their height. They have no discernible noses but seem capable of smelling,
 as they are shown smelling fruit and are affected by the Fart Gun. They are also shown without ears but can hear and respond to sounds.
 Most Minions appear either
 bald or with a few wispy strands of black hair on their heads. After leaving their home country 
 of Switzerland in favor of a new life in America during the late 1960s, their clothing consists of blue overalls emblazoned with Gru's logo,
 black rubber gloves, shoes, and goggles.
While shown as somewhat absent-minded and having very mischievous streaks,
 they also possess exceptional engineering abilities, being able to design and construct spaceships and playthings for Gru's adopted daughters,
 particularly the youngest, Agnes. Minions, the 2015 animated feature film, shows that they have existed since the beginning of life on Earth.
 Minions are biologically wired to seek out and serve the most terrible of villains; when they have no "boss" to serve, they become depressed and listless.
 They are also shown to have a degree of invulnerability, as Kevin, Stuart and Bob are able to survive a European torture chamber without any injuries, 
 even playing with the torture devices, and to survive being hit by dropped heavy objects. In the 2010 short film "Banana", the Minions are revealed
 to have an almost uncontrollable craving for fruit, especially bananas.</p></center>
