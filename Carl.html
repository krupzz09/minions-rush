<h3 align="justify">Carl is a one-eyed Minion character from the "Despicable Me" franchise. He is known for his unique appearance with one brown eye and spiky hair, often hidden beneath his siren hat. In the movies, Carl is memorable for his iconic line "bee-do-bee-do-bee-do!" which he repeats through a megaphone.<br><br>
Throughout the films, Carl has been involved in various comedic scenes, such as attempting to sing "Copacabana" with Phil and Mark. One notable moment includes Gru setting his phone on fire, leading to Carl entering the room repeating "bee-do" until he is sprayed with a fire extinguisher by Stuart, dressed as Lucy, to quiet him down.<br><br>
Carl is part of the larger group of Minions, small yellow creatures known for their mischievous and humorous antics. Alongside other main Minion characters like Stuart, Kevin, Bob, and Dave, Carl contributes to the comedic charm of the movies with his distinct personality and interactions with fellow Minions.</h3>
