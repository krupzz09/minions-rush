<p>Margo Gru is the adopted eldest daughter of Felonius Gru and Lucy Wilde. Before she was adopted, and much like her younger sisters, Edith and Agnes, she was an orphan horribly treated by Miss Hattie. Like Edith and Agnes, Margo wished to be adopted by somebody who would love them. She is very disapproving of Edith's mischief, shown where Edith jumps in puddles which gets her and Agnes wet, and also when she breaks a vial of acid in Gru's kitchen.

She does join in with Edith's antics if it's against someone she doesn't like. She finds it very endearing when Agnes says innocent childlike things (although she does display mild irritation at Agnes' fixation with unicorns), the total opposite of Edith, who finds it irritating.

Margo appears in all four of the Despicable Me films and several of the mini movies.</p></center>
