Minions are an all-male species of f
ictional yellow creatures that appear in Illumination's Despicable
 Me franchise. They are characterized by their childli
 ke behavior and their language, which is largely unintelligible.

The Minions serve as the official mascots for Illumination,
 and have also been described by The New York Times as "c
 
orporate icons" for Comcast in the years since their 2013 purchase of Illumination's parent company
 NBCUniversal; similar to Mickey Mouse for 
The Walt Disney Company, Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros.,
 Woody Woodpecker for Universal Pictures, SpongeBob SquarePants for Paramount Global or Mario for Nintendo.

Kevin, Stuart, and Bob are three of the most familiar 
minions, who appear as stars in the film Minions (2015) and its sequel Minions: The Rise of

 Gru (2022). Many other Minions are mentioned by name in the films and other media in the franchise.
 They were created by Eric Guillon, Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud.</p></center>
